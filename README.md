# Node.js Testing Without Libraries

This is a sample project demonstrating how to write, and run tests for Node.js without using an external library.

For the complete explanation, you can see my [blog post](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/javascript/making-a-node-js-test-runner/).

To run the tests, clone this repo and run:

```
npm test
```

You can change one of the tests in `calculator-test.js` and run `npm test` again to see the test failure message.
